# TigerPlace
Personal Project. Goods and Services marketplace built using flask and hosted on Google Cloud. Built with RIT students to sell unwanted items 
or offer services ex: tutoring.

## Inspiration
We wanted to find a way to make a positive impact on our local RIT community and came across the idea of creating a safe online marketplace 
for RIT students and alumni. We made this with our peers and ourselves in mind. We made something that we strongly believe will have a large 
positive impact on RIT.

## What it does
By using TigerPlace RIT students will be able to save money by getting better deals from community members all the while being able to be confident 
in their transactions because of the RIT verification process.

## How we built it
After brainstorming and deciding on TigerPlace we began to make mock-ups of the planned UI/UX designs. After setting up the Flask Framework and building
the Front-End we ended up all working on different aspects of the Back-End. During all this time we had one teammate handling the domain setup, server 
setup and build the database. Despite all doing different tasks, we were constantly communicating, helping and providing feedback to one another.
